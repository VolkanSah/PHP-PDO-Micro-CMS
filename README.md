## Overview
This Micro CMS is designed to provide a fundamental structure for managing content using PHP and MySQL. It serves as a starting point for developers to build upon, with a focus on simplicity and ease of use.

## Security Considerations

**WARNING:** This project is intended for educational purposes and **should not be used in production without proper security hardening**. Please consider the following:

* **Authentication and Authorization:** Implement robust user authentication and role-based access control.
* **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Ensure all user inputs are validated and sanitized to prevent XSS and SQL injection attacks.
* **HTTPS:** Enforce HTTPS to encrypt data in transit.
* **Keep Software Up-to-Date:** Regularly update PHP, MySQL, and all dependencies to ensure you have the latest security patches.
* **Error Handling:** Implement secure error handling to prevent information disclosure.
* **Password Storage:** Use a secure password hashing algorithm (e.g., Argon2, PBKDF2) to store user passwords.
